# What is _Machine Learning_? #

> **Machine learning** is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using that to make predictions and decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.   -- Wikipedia

# Elements of Machine Learning #

- Elements:
	- Data
	- Model
	- Learning Algorithms
	- Prediction
	
- Learn from old data, make predictions on new data. The common aspects of both the old and new data are captured by the model.

Please write down five machine learning algorithms that you know.

$\quad$

Don't write *Deep Learning*.

# What this Course is About #

- The course is *not* to teach you:
	- Support Vector Machine
	- Linear Regression
	- ...
	- Deep Learning
- Instead, you are going to learn *foundational theories and tools* for developing *your own* models and algorithms.
