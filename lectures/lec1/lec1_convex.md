# Convex Analysis

- Convex optimization plays a crucial role in many machine learning problems
- Prof. *Stephen Boyd* has a very famous book *"Convex Optimization"*, which provides an excellent treatment of this subject
    + The PDF version is available for download in Prof. Boyd's website
    + You should at least read the first five chapters

. . .

- Important Concepts in convex analysis
    + convex set
    + convex function
    + conjugate function
    + Lagrange dual
    + Strong duality and weak duality

- We will begin to use these concepts in Lecture 4.
