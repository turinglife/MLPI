# Roadmap #

Mathematics lies at the heart of machine learning research. In addition to *linear algebra* and *statistics*, the development of many learning methods is also closely related to *functional analysis*, *modern probability theory*, and *convex optimization*.

$\quad$

Complete coverage of all these subjects is obviously beyond the scope of this course. This lecture aims to give an overview of several important math concepts that are useful in the course.

# Concepts to Be Covered #

- Metrics
- Basics of topology
	- *open* and *closed sets*, *continuous function*, and *compact space*
- Basics of functional analysis: 
	- *norm*, *inner product*, *Banach space*, *Hilbert space*
	- *functional*, *operator*, and *bilinear form*
- Basics of modern probability theory: 
	- *measure space*, and *Lebesgue integration*
	- *random variables*, *expectation*, and *convergence of laws*.
- Convex set and convex functions
