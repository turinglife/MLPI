# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

- A generic MCMC method based on *Hamiltonian Dynamics*.
- Originally, it was devised for *molecular simulation*
- In 1987, a seminal paper by Duane, Kennedy, Pendleton, and Roweth unifies MCMC and molecular dynamics. They called this method *Hybrid Monte Carlo*, which abbreviates to *HMC*
- In many articles, people call it *Hamiltonian Monte Carlo*, as this name is considered to be more specific and informative, and it retains the same abbreviation "HMC".
