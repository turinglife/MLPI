# About this Course #

- This is a *graduate level* introduction to *statistical learning*. 
- The course is *not* to teach you:
	- Support Vector Machine
	- Linear Regression
	- ...
	- Deep Learning
- Instead, you are going to learn *foundational tools* for developing *your own* models and algorithms.

# Course Format #

- **No Exams!**
- Topic driven
- For each topic:
	- Introductory lecture
	- Paper reading and Homework
	- In-class discussion
- You will present a paper/subject at the end of the course

# What is _Machine Learning_? #

> **Machine learning** is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using that to make predictions and decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.   -- Wikipedia

# Elements of Machine Learning #

- Elements:
	- Data
	- Model
	- Learning Algorithms
	- Prediction
	
- Learn from old data, make predictions on new data. The common aspects of both the old and new data are captured by the model.

Please write down five machine learning algorithms that you know

Don't write *Deep Learning*!

# Topics #

- Exponential family distributions and conjugate prior
- Generalized linear model
- Empirical risk minimization and Stochastic gradient descent 
- Proximal methods for optimization
- Graphical models: Bayesian Networks and Markov random fields
- Sum-product and max-product algorithms, Belief propagation

# Math Prerequisites #

- Machine Learning is a subject that involves a lot of math
	- Especially true when you want to develop your own methods instead of calling something out of box.
- You should have learned:
	- Calculus
	- Linear algebra
	- (Classical) Probability theory and Statistics
	- Basic knowledge about Optimization
- *Are these sufficient?*
